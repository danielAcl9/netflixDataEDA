### Project Overview

Hey there! Welcome to this project where we're diving into a Netflix catalog dataset! The purpose of this project is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills. The main issues I wanted to address with this project are:

1. **Null Value Assessment**: How many null values did we encounter in our dataset, and are we able to remove them effectively?
2. **Column Pruning**: Which columns lack informative value, and why should they be considered for deletion from our dataset?
3. **Data Type Conversion**: What data type does the 'release_year' column possess, and can it be converted to an integer format for enhanced analysis?
4. **Data Transformation**: How can we extract valuable insights from the 'listed_in' column, particularly by creating a new column that retains the first value among the comma-separated entries?
